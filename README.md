Now hit the clone button and the project will be cloned to your computer. Once the project is loaded you will see errors like the image below. Don't worry its normal, it shows these errors because you need to download and load the required flutter packages required to run the project,

An other way to do it is through terminal. you can open terminal from launch pad and navigate to the project and run command "flutter pub get" or you can just open the terminal in android studio and run this command right here. To do so you need to click on terminal icon in bottom left and type "flutter pub get" and press enter as shown in image below
